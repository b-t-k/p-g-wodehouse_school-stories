<h2>
Work
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    With a pleasure that's emphatic
    We retire to our attic
    With the satisfying feeling that our duty has been done.

    Oh! philosophers may sing
    Of the troubles of a king
    But of pleasures there are many and of troubles there are none,
    And the culminating pleasure
    Which we treasure beyond measure
    Is the satisfying feeling that our duty has been done.

                                           <i>W. S. Gilbert</i>
</pre>
<p>
      Work is supposed to be the centre round which school life revolves—the
      hub of the school wheel, the lode-star of the schoolboy's existence, and a
      great many other things. 'You come to school to work', is the formula used
      by masters when sentencing a victim to the wailing and gnashing of teeth
      provided by two hours' extra tuition on a hot afternoon. In this, I think,
      they err, and my opinion is backed up by numerous scholars of my
      acquaintance, who have even gone so far—on occasions when they
      themselves have been the victims—as to express positive disapproval
      of the existing state of things. In the dear, dead days (beyond recall), I
      used often to long to put the case to my form-master in its only fair
      aspect, but always refrained from motives of policy. Masters are so apt to
      take offence at the well-meant endeavours of their form to instruct them
      in the way they should go.
    </p>
<p>
      What I should have liked to have done would have been something after this
      fashion. Entering the sanctum of the Headmaster, I should have motioned
      him to his seat—if he were seated already, have assured him that to
      rise was unnecessary. I should then have taken a seat myself, taking care
      to preserve a calm fixity of demeanour, and finally, with a preliminary
      cough, I should have embarked upon the following moving address: 'My dear
      sir, my dear Reverend Jones or Brown (as the case may be), believe me when
      I say that your whole system of work is founded on a fallacious dream and
      reeks of rottenness. No, no, I beg that you will not interrupt me. The
      real state of the case, if I may say so, is briefly this: a boy goes to
      school to enjoy himself, and, on arriving, finds to his consternation that
      a great deal more work is expected of him than he is prepared to do. What
      course, then, Reverend Jones or Brown, does he take? He proceeds to do as
      much work as will steer him safely between the, ah—I may say, the
      Scylla of punishment and the Charybdis of being considered what my, er—fellow-pupils
      euphoniously term a swot. That, I think, is all this morning. <i>Good</i>
      day. Pray do not trouble to rise. I will find my way out.' I should then
      have made for the door, locked it, if possible, on the outside, and,
      rushing to the railway station, have taken a through ticket to Spitzbergen
      or some other place where Extradition treaties do not hold good.
    </p>
<p>
      But 'twas not mine to play the Tib. Gracchus, to emulate the O. Cromwell.
      So far from pouring my opinions like so much boiling oil into the ear of
      my task-master, I was content to play the part of audience while <i>he</i>
      did the talking, my sole remark being 'Yes'r' at fixed intervals.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet I knew that I was in the right. My bosom throbbed with the justice
      of my cause. For why? The ambition of every human new boy is surely to
      become like J. Essop of the First Eleven, who can hit a ball over two
      ponds, a wood, and seven villages, rather than to resemble that pale young
      student, Mill-Stuart, who, though he can speak Sanskrit like a native of
      Sanskritia, couldn't score a single off a slow long-hop.
    </p>
<p>
      And this ambition is a laudable one. For the athlete is the product of
      nature—a step towards the more perfect type of animal, while the
      scholar is the outcome of artificiality. What, I ask, does the scholar
      gain, either morally or physically, or in any other way, by knowing who
      was tribune of the people in 284 BC or what is the precise difference
      between the various constructions of <i>cum</i>? It is not as if ignorance
      of the tribune's identity caused him any mental unrest. In short, what
      excuse is there for the student? 'None,' shrieks Echo enthusiastically.
      'None whatever.'
    </p>
<p>
      Our children are being led to ruin by this system. They will become dons
      and think in Greek. The victim of the craze stops at nothing. He puns in
      Latin. He quips and quirks in Ionic and Doric. In the worst stages of the
      disease he will edit Greek plays and say that Merry quite misses the fun
      of the passage, or that Jebb is mediocre. Think, I beg of you,
      paterfamilias, and you, mater ditto, what your feelings would be were you
      to find Henry or Archibald Cuthbert correcting proofs of <i>The Agamemnon</i>,
      and inventing 'nasty ones' for Mr Sidgwick! Very well then. Be warned.
    </p>
<p>
      Our bright-eyed lads are taught insane constructions in Greek and Latin
      from morning till night, and they come for their holidays, in many cases,
      without the merest foundation of a batting style. Ask them what a Yorker
      is, and they will say: 'A man from York, though I presume you mean a
      Yorkshireman.' They will read Herodotus without a dictionary for pleasure,
      but ask them to translate the childishly simple sentence: 'Trott was soon
      in his timber-yard with a length 'un that whipped across from the off,'
      and they'll shrink abashed and swear they have not skill at that, as
      Gilbert says.
    </p>
<p>
      The papers sometimes contain humorous forecasts of future education, when
      cricket and football shall come to their own. They little know the
      excellence of the thing they mock at. When we get schools that teach
      nothing but games, then will the sun definitely refuse to set on the roast
      beef of old England. May it be soon. Some day, mayhap, I shall gather my
      great-great-grandsons round my knee, and tell them—as one tells
      tales of Faery—that I can remember the time when Work was considered
      the be-all and the end-all of a school career. Perchance, when my
      great-great-grandson John (called John after the famous Jones of that
      name) has brought home the prize for English Essay on 'Rugby <i>v.</i>
      Association', I shall pat his head (gently) and the tears will come to my
      old eyes as I recall the time when I, too, might have won a prize—for
      that obsolete subject, Latin Prose—and was only prevented by the
      superior excellence of my thirty-and-one fellow students, coupled, indeed,
      with my own inability to conjugate <i>sum.</i>
</p>
<p>
      Such days, I say, may come. But now are the Dark Ages. The only thing that
      can possibly make Work anything but an unmitigated nuisance is the
      prospect of a 'Varsity scholarship, and the thought that, in the event of
      failure, a 'Varsity career will be out of the question.
    </p>
<p>
      With this thought constantly before him, the student can put a certain
      amount of enthusiasm into his work, and even go to the length of rising at
      five o'clock o' mornings to drink yet deeper of the cup of knowledge. I
      have done it myself. 'Varsity means games and yellow waistcoats and
      Proctors, and that sort of thing. It is worth working for.
    </p>
<p>
      But for the unfortunate individual who is barred by circumstances from
      participating in these joys, what inducement is there to work? Is such a
      one to leave the school nets in order to stew in a stuffy room over a
      Thucydides? I trow not.
    </p>
<p>
      Chapter one of my great forthcoming work, <i>The Compleat Slacker</i>,
      contains minute instructions on the art of avoiding preparation from
      beginning to end of term. Foremost among the words of advice ranks this
      maxim: Get an official list of the books you are to do, and examine them
      carefully with a view to seeing what it is possible to do unseen. Thus, if
      Virgil is among these authors, you can rely on being able to do him with
      success. People who ought to know better will tell you that Virgil is
      hard. Such a shallow falsehood needs little comment. A scholar who cannot
      translate ten lines of <i>The Aeneid</i> between the time he is put on and
      the time he begins to speak is unworthy of pity or consideration, and if I
      meet him in the street I shall assuredly cut him. Aeschylus, on the other
      hand, is a demon, and needs careful watching, though in an emergency you
      can always say the reading is wrong.
    </p>
<p>
      Sometimes the compleat slacker falls into a trap. The saddest case I can
      remember is that of poor Charles Vanderpoop. He was a bright young lad,
      and showed some promise of rising to heights as a slacker. He fell in this
      fashion. One Easter term his form had half-finished a speech of
      Demosthenes, and the form-master gave them to understand that they would
      absorb the rest during the forthcoming term. Charles, being naturally
      anxious to do as little work as possible during the summer months, spent
      his Easter holidays carefully preparing this speech, so as to have it
      ready in advance. What was his horror, on returning to School at the
      appointed date, to find that they were going to throw Demosthenes over
      altogether, and patronize Plato. Threats, entreaties, prayers—all
      were accounted nothing by the master who had led him into this morass of
      troubles. It is believed that the shock destroyed his reason. At any rate,
      the fact remains that that term (the summer term, mark you) he won two
      prizes. In the following term he won three. To recapitulate his outrages
      from that time to the present were a harrowing and unnecessary task.
      Suffice it that he is now a Regius Professor, and I saw in the papers a
      short time ago that a lecture of his on 'The Probable Origin of the Greek
      Negative', created quite a <i>furore</i>. If this is not Tragedy with a
      big T, I should like to know what it is.
    </p>
<p>
      As an exciting pastime, unseen translation must rank very high. Everyone
      who has ever tried translating unseen must acknowledge that all other
      forms of excitement seem but feeble makeshifts after it. I have, in the
      course of a career of sustained usefulness to the human race, had my share
      of thrills. I have asked a strong and busy porter, at Paddington, when the
      Brighton train started. I have gone for the broad-jump record in trying to
      avoid a motor-car. I have played Spillikins and Ping-Pong. But never again
      have I felt the excitement that used to wander athwart my moral backbone
      when I was put on to translate a passage containing a notorious <i>crux</i>
      and seventeen doubtful readings, with only that innate genius, which is
      the wonder of the civilized world, to pull me through. And what a glow of
      pride one feels when it is all over; when one has made a glorious, golden
      guess at the <i>crux</i>, and trampled the doubtful readings under foot
      with inspired ease. It is like a day at the seaside.
    </p>
<p>
      Work is bad enough, but Examinations are worse, especially the Board
      Examinations. By doing from ten to twenty minutes prep every night, the
      compleat slacker could get through most of the term with average success.
      Then came the Examinations. The dabbler in unseen translations found
      himself caught as in a snare. Gone was the peaceful security in which he
      had lulled to rest all the well-meant efforts of his guardian angel to
      rouse him to a sense of his duties. There, right in front of him, yawned
      the abyss of Retribution.
    </p>
<p>
      Alas! poor slacker. I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of
      most excellent fancy. Where be his gibes now? How is he to cope with the
      fiendish ingenuity of the examiners? How is he to master the contents of a
      book of Thucydides in a couple of days? It is a fearsome problem. Perhaps
      he will get up in the small hours and work by candle light from two till
      eight o'clock. In this case he will start his day a mental and physical
      wreck. Perhaps he will try to work and be led away by the love of light
      reading.
    </p>
<p>
      In any case he will fail to obtain enough marks to satisfy the examiners,
      though whether examiners ever are satisfied, except by Harry the hero of
      the school story (Every Lad's Library, uniform edition, 2s 6d), is rather
      a doubtful question.
    </p>
<p>
      In such straits, matters resolve themselves into a sort of drama with
      three characters. We will call our hero Smith.
    </p>

<i>Scene:</i> a Study
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
<i>Dramatis Personae:</i>
            SMITH
            CONSCIENCE
            MEPHISTOPHELES
</pre>
<p>
<i>Enter</i> SMITH (<i>down centre</i>)
    </p>
<p>
<i>He seats himself at table and opens a Thucydides.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Enter</i> CONSCIENCE <i>through ceiling</i> (R.), MEPHISTOPHELES <i>through
      floor</i> (L.).
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE (<i>with a kindly smile</i>): Precisely what I was about to
      remark, my dear lad. A little Thucydides would be a very good thing.
      Thucydides, as you doubtless know, was a very famous Athenian historian.
      Date?
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Er—um—let me see.
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH. (<i>aside</i>): Look in the Introduction and pretend you did it by
      accident.
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH (<i>having done so</i>): 431 B.C. <i>circ</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE <i>wipes away a tear</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE: Thucydides made himself a thorough master of the concisest of
      styles.
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: And in doing so became infernally obscure. Excuse shop.
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH (<i>gloomily</i>): Hum!
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH. (<i>sneeringly</i>): Ha!
    </p>
<p>
<i>Long pause</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE (<i>gently</i>): Do you not think, my dear lad, that you had
      better begin? Time and tide, as you are aware, wait for no man. And—
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Yes?
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE: You have not, I fear, a very firm grasp of the subject.
      However, if you work hard till eleven—
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH (<i>gloomily</i>): Hum! Three hours!
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH. (<i>cheerily</i>): Exactly so. Three hours. A little more if
      anything. By the way, excuse me asking, but have you prepared the subject
      thoroughly during the term?
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: My <i>dear</i> sir! Of <i>course!</i>
</p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE (<i>reprovingly</i>):???!!??!
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Well, perhaps, not quite so much as I might have done. Such a lot
      of things to do this term. Cricket, for instance.
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Rather. Talking of cricket, you seemed to be shaping rather well
      last Saturday. I had just run up on business, and someone told me you made
      eighty not out. Get your century all right?
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH (<i>brightening at the recollection</i>): Just a bit—117 not
      out. I hit—but perhaps you've heard?
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Not at all, not at all. Let's hear all about it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>CONSCIENCE seeks to interpose, but is prevented by MEPH., who eggs
      SMITH on to talk cricket for over an hour.</i>
</p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE <i>(at last; in an acid voice)</i>: That is a history of the
      Peloponnesian War by Thucydides on the table in front of you. I thought I
      would mention it, in case you had forgotten.
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Great Scott, yes! Here, I say, I must start.
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE: Hear! Hear!
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH. <i>(insinuatingly)</i>: One moment. Did you say you <i>had</i>
      prepared this book during the term? Afraid I'm a little hard of hearing.
      Eh, what?
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Well—er—no, I have not. Have you ever played billiards
      with a walking-stick and five balls?
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Quite so, quite so. I quite understand. Don't you distress
      yourself, old chap. You obviously can't get through a whole book of
      Thucydides in under two hours, can you?
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE <i>(severely)</i>: He might, by attentive application to study,
      master a considerable portion of the historian's <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> in
      that time.
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Yes, and find that not one of the passages he had prepared was set
      in the paper.
    </p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE: At the least, he would, if he were to pursue the course which
      I have indicated, greatly benefit his mind.
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH. <i>gives a short, derisive laugh. Long pause.</i>
</p>
<p>
      MEPH. <i>(looking towards bookshelf)</i>: Hullo, you've got a decent lot
      of books, pommy word you have. <i>Rodney Stone, Vice Versa, Many Cargoes.</i>
      Ripping. Ever read <i>Many Cargoes?</i>
</p>
<p>
      CONSCIENCE <i>(glancing at his watch)</i>: I am sorry, but I must really
      go now. I will see you some other day.
    </p>
<p>
<i>Exit sorrowfully.</i>
</p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Well, thank goodness <i>he's</i> gone. Never saw such a fearful old
      bore in my life. Can't think why you let him hang on to you so. We may as
      well make a night of it now, eh? No use your trying to work at this time
      of night.
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Not a bit.
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Did you say you'd not read <i>Many Cargoes?</i>
</p>
<p>
      SMITH: Never. Only got it today. Good?
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Simply ripping. All short stories. Make you yell.
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH <i>(with a last effort)</i>: But don't you think—
    </p>
<p>
      MEPH.: Oh no. Besides, you can easily get up early tomorrow for the
      Thucydides.
    </p>
<p>
      SMITH: Of course I can. Never thought of that. Heave us <i>Many Cargoes.</i>
      Thanks.
    </p>
<p>
<i>Begins to read. MEPH. grins fiendishly, and vanishes through floor
      enveloped in red flame. Sobbing heard from the direction of the ceiling.
      </i>
</p>
<p>
      Scene closes.
    </p>
<p>
      Next morning, of course, he will oversleep himself, and his Thucydides
      paper will be of such a calibre that that eminent historian will writhe in
      his grave.
